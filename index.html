<p>My dearest uncle, you were not just a relative, but a cherished friend and brother to me. Born several years ahead, you were my childhood companion, my partner in mischief, and my source of unwavering support.
<br>Together, we roamed the fields, chasing after elusive prey with our small bows and arrows, or aiming our catapults at the birds that dared to stray too close. Each adventure we embarked on was a testament to our bond, a bond that was unbreakable despite the challenges life threw our way.
<br>Your battle with epilepsy was a part of our journey, but it never defined you in my eyes. We faced it together, with courage and resilience, finding solace in each other's company even as the condition gradually worsened over time.
<br>As I pursued my education in high school, my thoughts were always with you, my dear Malombe. I dreamed of becoming a doctor, or finding a cure that would alleviate your suffering and bring you the peace you so rightfully deserved.
<br>But fate had other plans, and your last days were marked by unbearable pain and anguish. It pains me to know that I was unable to ease your suffering, that I couldn't be there for you when you needed me the most.
<br>You departed this world engulfed in agony, and for that, I am filled with regret and sorrow. But I take comfort in the hope that you have found peace and true love in the arms of heaven, where pain and suffering hold no sway.
<br>Though I may never know where your journey has taken you, I pray that you rest in eternal peace, my dear Malombe. Your memory will forever be engraved in my heart, a beacon of love and inspiration guiding me through life's trials and tribulations.
<br>Until we meet again, farewell, beloved friend.
<br>With love and heartfelt remembrance,
<p>
<br>Your nephew and childhood friend, 
<br>Timothy Mutua.
